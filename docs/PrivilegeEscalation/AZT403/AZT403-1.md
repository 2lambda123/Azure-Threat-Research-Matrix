	## **Detection Details**

	A storage account is created in order to store the profile .IMG file when using CloudShell. These storage accounts always start with `cs` followed by a string of numbers + letters. E.g.: `cs120000000ff`
	Logs from the storage account require them to be configured with diagnostic settings being sent to a log aggregator. 
	
	Additionally, `~/.config/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` is where the PowerShell startup script is stored, which also may be a target for backdooring.
